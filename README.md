Self-Reflection
Working on VirtualShelf helped me learn how to fetch data from live APIs and handle it dynamically in the browser. I improved my skills in DOM manipulation, state management, and localStorage to keep the movie collection persistent.  Implementing features like live search, preventing duplicates, and format selection taught me how to design a better user experience. Handling missing data, updating the UI dynamically, and sorting the collection alphabetically were challenging but valuable tasks. Overall, this project strengthened my problem-solving skills and gave me practical experience in building a dynamic, API-driven front-end application.
